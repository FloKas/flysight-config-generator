## Not working alpha-version online for now!


**roadmap:** (more or less in priority order)

*2016*
- upload first working beta-version 
- option to choose if a "stripped down" or a "complete version" of the config-file will be generated (first version will be "stripped down" only)
- show filecontent in a box to copypaste (with mark all option, or only botton "copy to clipboard")
-option exclude a specific section (in this case "dz_elev")

*2017*
- guided version. in a few steps? (first dummy-version? where you are only able to configure/change basic settings, like alarms, speech yes/no, beeps yes/no. already in progress...)
- add option to choose preconfigured alarm settings
- add option to choose specific PPC-time-distance-speed-settings


- add multi-config-file-creation
- add zip-download (audio- and config-folder included)
- (take "dz_elev" out of the config-files in the config-folder and only put it in the root-config.txt when multiple config-files are used and add new no alarm window, the functions which were added with the latest firmware release from september 2016).
