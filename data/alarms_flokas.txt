; WARNING: GPS measurements depend on very weak signals
;          received from orbiting satellites. As such, they
;          are prone to interference, and should NEVER be
;          relied upon for life saving purposes.
;          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THESE ALARMS BE
;          USED TO INDICATE DEPLOYMENT OR BREAKOFF ALTITUDE.
