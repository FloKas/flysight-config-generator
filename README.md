# flysight-config-generator

Online config.txt generator for [Flysight](http://www.flysight.ca) GPS.


## No working version online for now!


**roadmap:** (more or less in priority order)
- upload first working basis-version 
- show filecontent in a box to copypaste
- highlight missing options "red" in the check-routine
- add comment-field in the config.txt-header for easy file 
- add date when file was created into the header as an option
- add "created by" in the header
- add option to choose name of file to download
- (take "dz_elev" out of the config-files in the config-folder and only put it in the root-config.txt when multiple config-files are used and add new no alarm window, the functions which were added with the latest firmware release from september 2016).
- implement "create config.txt for dummies"-function (where you are only able to change basic settings, like alarms, speech yes/no, beeps yes/no...)
- add option to choose preconfigured alarm settings
- add option to choose PPC-settings
- add option to activate optimized settings (7 instead of 6, soundvolume maximized)


- add multi-config-file-creation-option
- add zip-download-option (audio- and config-folder included)

- add flyblind options

- add more audiofiles (perhaps really also request to add (some of) them the original firmware release? Or special (german) language pack(s) / add-ons?)

- swoop swoop options?
